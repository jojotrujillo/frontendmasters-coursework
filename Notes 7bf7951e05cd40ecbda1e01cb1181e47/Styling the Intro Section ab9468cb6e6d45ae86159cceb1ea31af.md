## Takeaways

- The line-height property is used to set the height of a line box between two lines of text. The preferred way to set a value for line-height is to make it unitless, e.g. 1.5, to make it relative to the elementâ€™s own font size. More info below ðŸ‘‡

- The span tagâ€™s default display type is inline so if you want it on its own line youâ€™ll need to override it by inserting the value of display: block;.
- If importing from Google Fonts, the weight of the fonts could be determined by the link string so you could play around with the font-weight property to style it exactly how you want it.
