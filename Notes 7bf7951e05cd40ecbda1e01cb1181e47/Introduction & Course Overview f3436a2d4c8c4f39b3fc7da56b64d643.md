## Course Objectives

- Create a two-page website from scratch using HTML and CSS, only basic prior knowledge required
- Learn the basics of including CSS in your web pages and organizing your styles
- Understand how HTML and CSS work together to create meaningful, beautiful web pages
- Style text, images, navigation, headers, footers, and more, learning techniques that will carry into future CSS work.

## Why am I taking this course?

Iâ€™m taking this course as a refresher on foundational CSS knowledge because I never dove deep enough into the subject while at either Metro or UNO. My position now could entail a great deal of frontend development, so I better learn the basics before learning more advanced topics on CSS.

## Expectations

Jen says herself that this course is meant for beginning beginners or junior developers that would enjoy the problem solving aspects. So I expect to learn a little more in-depth knowledge regarding CSS and continue to learn more best practices and patterns for styling.
