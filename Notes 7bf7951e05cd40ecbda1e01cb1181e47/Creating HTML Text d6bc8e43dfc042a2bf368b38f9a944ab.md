## Takeaways

- When coming up with content (text) itâ€™s important to consider the HTML that will be used to mark the text up because good markup leads to great design.
- After youâ€™ve come up with textual content, now you can determine the semantics behind it. For example, what parts of the text need headings while other parts could use p tags or spans to convey importance.
    - If you need to style words mid-sentence than itâ€™s best practice to use a span tag instead of headings since a full sentence wonâ€™t typically having headings in the middle of them.
    - ids can be used to link to certain sections within the same page.
