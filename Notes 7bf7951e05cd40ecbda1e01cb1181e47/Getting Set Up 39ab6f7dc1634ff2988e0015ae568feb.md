## Project Preparation

The course capstone is a two-page portfolio website that Jen has most assets for but itâ€™s recommended that we pull together our own style and content.

- Use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore) to choose a color palette.
- Choose a font pairing for text. We could use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [FontPair](https://www.fontpair.co/) if we need help choosing.
- Youâ€™ll need a professional photo of yourself
- Three examples of your work to show off in the portfolio. Also, text descriptions on the examples would be good.
- Links to your GitHub and/or LinkedIn pages.
- Optional: copy of digital rÃ©sumÃ©

## Technology Requirements

- Again, VS Code is the recommended text editor and Google Chrome is the recommended web browser
- Jen also recommends [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) to help with easily demoing code
- Hereâ€™s a link to the CodePen collection for this course ðŸ‘‡
