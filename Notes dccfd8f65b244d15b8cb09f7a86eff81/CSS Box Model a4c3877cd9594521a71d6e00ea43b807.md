Think of the box model as the premise behind CSS when considering page layouts. It’s how CSS “models” HTML elements. An example of what’s possible with CSS regarding page layouts:

## Display Types

Every tag in CSS has a display property by default. divs, for example, by default are display: block; while spans by default are display: inline;. Here’s a list of options for the display property:

`inline` – It makes whatever the `tag` is behave like text. The key here is the browser will determine all the height, width, padding, margins, etc. for you and **will not let you change it**. If you have something and you're trying to set the width or height and it's not respecting it, it's probably the wrong `display` type.

`block` – `div`s and `p`s by default are `display: block;`. This gives you control over the height, width, padding, margins, etc. of something. By default, something that is `block` takes the whole line to itself.

`inline-block` – A hybrid of the previous two. This will make the browser try to place the tag inline, but will still allow you to control the height, width, padding, and margins.

`flex` and `inline-flex` – Similar to `block` in that it affects the tags around it like `block` does, however it gains some new super powers.

`grid` and `inline-grid` – More advance display mode that allows you more power to layout tags *inside* of them.

`table` – Make something act like a `table`. In general, use the `<table></table>` tag instead of using CSS to make things act like `table`s.

## Height, Width, Padding, Border, and Margin

`margin` – This is the space **outside** of the element between it and other elements. If you give something a `background-color`, it will not color in the margin space. This is used to space elements out from other elements.

`border` – If your element has a border, it comes next (not everything has or needs a border.)

`padding` – Inside the border is the `padding`. This is the spacing **inside** the element. If you give something a `background-color`, you will color the padding space. In our diagram above, you can see the space between the red, solid border and the green, dashed border. This is the padding of the element.

## Notes on Sizing

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

- * - Wildcard operator. Says, “select and apply styling rules to all elements.”
- If box-sizing property is set to content-box then it will not include either the border or padding when considering the width property.
- To make it easier on us devs, make sure to include the above CSS rule in all stylesheets to include border size and padding size when adjusting width. [Paul Irish says it’s ok](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

## A Primer on float

The idea behind float is you'll an element to push itself as far left or right as possible, and once it's out of space, go to the next line:

You'll see the boxes will wrap themselves once they run out of room and box 3 wraps as you would expect. However, once you wrap **both** boxes 2 and 3, you'll see that box 3 won't go all the way up next to 1; it stays at the same vertical position as 2. Since box 2 is higher in the HTML, box 3 cannot go higher on the page due to the way that CSS works.
