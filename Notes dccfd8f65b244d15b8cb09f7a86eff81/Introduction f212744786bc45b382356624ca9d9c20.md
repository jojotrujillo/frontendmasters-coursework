## Why am I taking this course?

I’m taking this course as a refresher on foundational web development technical knowledge on topics ranging from HTML to JavaScript. It’s important to periodically relearn some of these technologies to be aware of any new features, patterns, and/or methodologies.

## Setup

- Checkout [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as an editor font.
- Note typography and the science behind ligatures ☝️
- We’re already familiar with VS Code and its different extensions.

## Expectations

The only expectation I have for this course is to keep me aware of and learn new aspects of foundational web development knowledge to stay fresh on these topics.
