### Code Editors

I have a lot of experience with both [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and JetBrains WebStorm. We use [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) at work since itâ€™s an IDE versus a text editor. However, [Nova](https://nova.app/) looks interesting but I donâ€™t use Apple products nor am I willing to pay to use an editor when thereâ€™s free options.

### Web Browsers

Iâ€™m familiar with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. I also kind of like Mozillaâ€™s [Firefox: Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/).

Mention CodePen

### Resources

- For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Mozilla'sÂ [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is my go-to.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)Â has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for CSS but for HTML and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more technical how-to info, I head to MDN.
- If I'm working with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to theirÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/)Â (we'll talk about GitHub later) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straight to the source.
- Frontend Masters also puts out a really awesome book every year called theÂ [Frontend Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2019/). It's a good way to get an overview of the whole industry.

## What are we going to learn?

### HTML

HyperText Markup Language [https://whatwg.org/](https://whatwg.org/)

HTML is declarative markup that is interpreted by web browsers to display web pages in them. It's important to know HTML because it is the semantic structure, or content of modern day websites. There is several external entities that rely on good quality HTML like SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Accessibility readers, and web crawlers. It's also important to learn because many of our (Kiewitâ€™s) custom-built enterprise applications are web-based and thus require knowledge of quality sematic structure using HTML.

### ~~CSS~~

~~CSS stands for cascading stylesheets. You can think of it as theÂ *style* of a website. What type of font is being used, what the background color is, what is bolded, what the spacing is, what the layout is, etc. CSS is basically just a series of rules that says "if an element matches this selector, apply this style."~~

### ~~JavaScript~~

~~JavaScript was specifically invented for the purpose of running on webpages but it has now grown beyond that and is being run in a great many places. HTML and CSS describe a non-interactive webpage, like a page in a book. All the content, pictures, fonts, spacing, etc. is all there and it can be read. The page in a book is not interactive though; if you try to touch your book like a touchscreen, well, it's not going to do much. Think of JavaScript being the piece that transform a non-interactive page out of a book to a touchscreen app. Whereas you had text, font, colors, images, etc. all before, now you can have things move around, have pop ups, refresh content, start animations, all sorts of stuff.~~
