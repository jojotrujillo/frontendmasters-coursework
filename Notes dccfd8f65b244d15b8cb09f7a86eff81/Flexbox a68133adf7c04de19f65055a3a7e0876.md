ℹ️ For a deeper dive on flex, check out [this from CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

The flex display property is applied to parent containers to adjust their children elements. The following shows the flex-container class which is applied to a parent div but the flex property is applied to the children divs. Besides acting on children elements, flex acts similarly to display: block; and inline-flex acts like inline-block.

## flex-direction

☝️ Looks similar to the floats, but notice if you make the page more narrow, the boxes will squish instead of wrapping.

👇 row-reverse reverses the children elements.

## justify-content

ℹ️ justify-content justifies content horizontally

Notice this is different from the reversed one because the items stayed in the same order. By default, the `justify-content` is `flex-start` which is like left-justified.

☝️ This one puts the first on the left and the last one on the right. It then aims to space out the items in the middle equally. Very useful for laying out columns on your web page.

## align-items

ℹ️ align-items aligns items vertically

Similar to flex-end for justify-content, flex-end for align-items pushes the elements down to the bottom of the container.

☝️ Need to remove height property for stretch to truly stretch elements

## flex-grow

With flex-grow you're telling it what proportion for it to use for its width. In our case, we have a 1, a 5, and a 10. So box-1 will take 1/16, box-2 will take 5/16, and box-3 will take 10/16 of the available width.

### Last Note

You can make multiple rows using `flex-wrap`. There are also a slew of properties that the children elements can have (everything we have done so far goes on the parent class) that you can affect things like order using `order` and you can individually override the `align-items` using `align-self`.
