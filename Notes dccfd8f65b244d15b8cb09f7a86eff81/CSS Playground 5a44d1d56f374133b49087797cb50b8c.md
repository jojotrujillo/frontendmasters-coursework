## Things to Know

- Not all CSS properties flow down to children selectors. Font color is one of the properties that do flow down unlike border.

## Refresher on Classes

```html
<h1 class="branding">My Super Cool Brand</h1>
<!-- other htmls … these don't have to be sibiling tags -->
<h1 class="blog-post-title">My Cool Blog Post</h1>
```

```css
.branding {
	color: red;
}

.blog-post-title {
	color: limegreen;
}
```

Classes allow us to style the same **tags** (e.g. `p`, `div`, `span`, etc.) differently because we can select the class instead of the tag. You can also apply classes to different tag types.

In the CSS, notice the `.` (period) before the class name. This is how you differentiate between a tag name (like `h1`) and a class name (like "branding".)

So what should you use, generally speaking, classes. This is the consensus in the front end development community. Classes are the best way to style web pages.
