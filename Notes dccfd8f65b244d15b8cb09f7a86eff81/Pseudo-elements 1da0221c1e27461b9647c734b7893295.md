[Read here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/) for a more deep dive on this. Let's have a quick example:

```html
<div class="chapter">This is a chapter of my book.</div>

<div class="chapter">This is a second chapter of my book.</div>

<style>
  .chapter p {
    margin: 0;
  }
  .chapter::after {
    content: "❦";
    font-size: 50px;
    text-align: center;
    display: block;
  }
</style>
```

Every element has a `::before` and an `::after`. You can use these *pseudo-elements* to insert things there like we did with the fleuron.
